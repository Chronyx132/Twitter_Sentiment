# Twitter Sentiment
Machine Learning Model for NUS IT1244 Group Project

## Introduction
This project explores the application of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques to perform sentiment analysis on twitter posts. The goal is to classify the sentiment of a written tweet as positive or negative. A deeper understanding of sentiment trends can benefit businesses in refining marketing strategies, assist policymakers in gauging public opinion on key issues, and help researchers improve sentiment analysis models.

## Project Overview
This project explores Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques for sentiment analysis (SA) of tweets. The goal is to classify tweets into positive/negative sentiments by leveraging linguistic and contextual patterns. Key contributions include:

Comparative analysis of traditional ML models (Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, KNN) and DL architectures (BERT-based neural networks).

A custom cluster-based DL model for specialized sentiment classification.

Optimization strategies (AdamW, hyperparameter tuning, efficiency metrics) to enhance performance.
