Dataset Information:
This dataset contains twitter tweets along with their associated binary sentiment labels (1: positive, 0: negative). It is intended to serve as a benchmark for sentiment classification. All records are stored in a CSV file. We want to see how you handle conversational English which can be quite different from formal English. In such English writing, you will see misspelled words, area-specific jargons, mentions, numeric characters and punctations at unexpected places, and many others.
Make sure to divide the dataset into 80% train and 20% test set. Perform 5-fold cross validation on the training dataset to develop and choose your model. The remaining 20% should be kept only for testing the final model.
