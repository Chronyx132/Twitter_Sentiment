# Twitter Sentiment
Machine Learning Model for NUS IT1244 Group Project

## Introduction
This project explores the application of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques to perform sentiment analysis on twitter posts. The goal is to classify the sentiment of a written tweet as positive or negative. A deeper understanding of sentiment trends can benefit businesses in refining marketing strategies, assist policymakers in gauging public opinion on key issues, and help researchers improve sentiment analysis models.

Dataset Information:
This dataset contains twitter tweets along with their associated binary sentiment labels (1: positive, 0: negative). It is intended to serve as a benchmark for sentiment classification. All records are stored in a CSV file. We want to see how you handle conversational English which can be quite different from formal English. In such English writing, you will see misspelled words, area-specific jargons, mentions, numeric characters and punctations at unexpected places, and many others.
Make sure to divide the dataset into 80% train and 20% test set. Perform 5-fold cross validation on the training dataset to develop and choose your model. The remaining 20% should be kept only for testing the final model.
